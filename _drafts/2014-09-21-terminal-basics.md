# Command references

The chances of be a programmer and not using linux or linux like OS are really small. So I am writing this article to give you place with all basic commands in linux terminal that you can check until you remember all of them. I am not giving all the options and use cases, but the most common and useful ones.

`Explain about options and files`
`Explain about help`

## Navigation

### ls [OPTION] [FILE] (list directory)

Used to list files and folders in directory. But how this command is use for navigation? It`s not. but you can not navigate without it. When you navigating you want to see files and dirs in current dir.

Options:

* -a - show all files(even dot files)
* -l - show files with detailed list
* -al - show all files with detailed list

### cd [FILE] (current directory)

Used to change current directory. You can not navigate without this command. There are two options with the command but they are useless.

cd ..
cd /test


## File commands

### mkdir [FILE]

### rm [OPTION] [FILE]

Options

-r -recursive - remove directories and their contents recursively
-d - directory - remove directories

### cp (Copy)




### grep [link](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-use-grep-command-in-linux-unix/)
