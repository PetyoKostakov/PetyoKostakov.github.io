1) Understanding DOM (what is that, how is it related to HTML etc)
2) Understanding XML/namespaces
3) Understanding JavaScript (object-oriented? what otherwise)
4) Knowing approaches to componentization (XBL, HTC) - plus
5) Understanding OO principles
6) JavaScript closures
7) Memory leaks in browsers


Ask them about their opinions about what is on the horizon (HTML 5, IE 8, Chrome, etc) to see if they keep abreast of what's coming out.

does the candidate have JavaScript errors? if they do, does the person let them bubble up to the presentation layer or do they at least catch them with a try/catch block?

. Being able to properly break down a design into its semantic components, identifying sections and separating primary and secondary content from navigation is not math or science and therefore hard to test.

We were asked a couple of questions about DOM, Object-Orientation, Closures, XML Namespaces and general Web Design

A simple three column layout
A good-looking table using CSS
A usable but good-looking Navigation Bar.
