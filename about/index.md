# About the blog

We live in world full of information to be able to find the right material for your needs is very difficult. This blog is more *reference* to great sources 
of knowledge that can help you learn or master about different parts of programming. I prefer to use [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself) principle and to give you reference to great article, book or some kind of material instead to repeat what is already writed and explained. If some material has something that is missing for me I will increment it or will summarize it for you.
